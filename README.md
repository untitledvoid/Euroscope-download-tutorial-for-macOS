# Euroscope-download-tutorial-for-macOS

With this tutorial you can get Euroscope up and running on a macOS computer. I've installed Euroscope with this tutorial on an i7 macbook pro and an i5 iMac both running macOS Monterey version 12.7.4 (in short, I didn't install them on a mac running a silicon chip so I have no idea if it works on those).

## **Hardware needed:**
A computer running macOS (version doesn't matter as long as the version of macOS supports wineskin winery, track audio and/or vector audio).

## **Software needed:**
Xcode: Installed via the app store **OR** if you have an older version of macOS that doesn't support the latest Xcode version you can go [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/), press "Additional tools" and find the latest Xcode your current macOS version supports (which you can do by just googling it);

Xcode select: Xcode select **is needed** and the installation is through the terminal (as you'll see in the tutorial); 

Homebrew: Open the terminal and copy/paste */bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"*

Wineskin Winery: Open the terminal and copy/paste *brew install --cask --no-quarantine gcenx/wine/unofficial-wineskin*

## **Tutorial**

1- Open the appstore, search for Xcode and install it (~10gb). You can also install it through apples developer portal depending on your version (refer to the software requirements section above).
2- After Xcode has finished installing open the terminal and install Xcode select using *Xcode-select --install*
3- Install Homebrew and Wineskin Winery (refer to the software requirements section above).
4- Open Wineskin Winery and create an engine (selecy the latest version)
